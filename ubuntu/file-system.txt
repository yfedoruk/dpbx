I usually put my own scripts in ~/bin, my own scripts that I need for my setup to work in ~/.local/sbin, and I clone git repos to ~/.local/src if compiled, ~/.local/lib if not compiled, and ~/.local/opt if I just downloaded the binaries. I symlink all the binaries to ~/.local/bin so I get automatic updates by just cloning and building again
