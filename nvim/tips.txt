Clear nvim cache
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim

Show option/value
:lua print(vim.o.<option>)

This command will list all global variables:
:let g:
Using :let by itself will list all variables, and passing it just a prefix (such as g: or b: or v:) will filter the output to only include variables in that prefix.
