For version 2019.3.3 on Windows:

Delete files in 'C:\Users{user}.IntelliJIdea{idea-version}\config\eval' directory.

That should do it.

Otherwise you also have information about evaluation and machine id in the following locations:

File 'C:\Users{user}.IntelliJIdea{idea-version}\config\options\other.xml' -> all properties that start with 'evlsprt*'
Registry 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs' with key '/Jet/Brains./User/Id/On/Machine'
Registry 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\jetbrains'
