1. Launch the application
2. Fire up a terminal and run xprop WM_CLASS. Click on the window of the the application that is running with a duplicate icon.
3. You'll get some output like WM_CLASS(STRING) = "Navigator", "Firefox". Choose one of the classes, eg Firefox in this example
4. Add the class as the value of StartupWMClass in the .desktop file. For example, StartupWMClass=Firefox
